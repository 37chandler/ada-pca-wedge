# Applied Data Analytics: Principal Components Analysis

This repo holds code for principal components analysis.

The main work is in `pca_assignment.Rmd`. Look for questions to answer and 
code sections asking you to do work. The data is posted on Moodle, since 
the final data set is somewhat large.
